        "Text": "### Optimization\nTo reiterate, the loss function lets us quantify the quality of any particular set of weights **W**. The goal of optimization is to find **W** that minimizes the loss function. We will now motivate and slowly develop an approach to optimizing the loss function. For those of you coming to this class with previous experience, this section might seem odd since the working example we’ll use (the SVM loss) is a convex problem, but keep in mind that our goal is to eventually optimize Neural Networks where we can’t easily use any of the tools developed in the Convex Optimization literature.\n### Strategy #1: A first very bad idea solution: Random search\nSince it is so simple to check how good a given set of parameters **W** is, the first (very bad) idea that may come to mind is to simply try out many different random weights and keep track of what works best. This procedure might look as follows:"
